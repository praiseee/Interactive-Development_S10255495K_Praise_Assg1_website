In this assignment, I have chosen to code a webpage about Green Day. This webpage will function as a platform for fans to purchase concert tickets and many more. The webpage will have a section just for tikcets, where the date, time and country will be stated for fans to be informed about the tours. They will also be allowed to buy official tour tickets through this wbebpage. There will be another section for merchans where fans are able to browse and purchase official merchandise like t-shirts, CDs and posters. Another secton will be dedicated to media for fans to download any songs they desire. For certain application, it will be directed to the app itself for download. 

I chose this band because it was my first ever concert at Fomula 1 and I went in free! Although it's an oldie song, I treasured the memories more, hence greenday.
